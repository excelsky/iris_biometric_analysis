`iris_biometric_sequence_analysis.ipynb` show how to analyze Iris Biometric Data. This dataset is different from Iris Flower Data. It is about eyes and we got it from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/naureenmohammad/mmu-iris-dataset). It consists of both 5 images each of left and right IRIS of 45 persons, totalling 450 images.

We use Naive Bayse to analyze the iris movement sequence.
